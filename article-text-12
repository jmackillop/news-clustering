SAN FRANCISCO — Iranian hackers targeted hundreds of email accounts associated with at least one presidential campaign, as well as those of American journalists and current and former United States government officials, according to Microsoft.

In a report released on Friday, Microsoft said the hackers, with apparent backing from Iran’s government, made more than 2,700 attempts to identify the email accounts of current and former government officials, journalists covering political campaigns and accounts associated with one major presidential campaign.

Microsoft would not name the campaign.

The revelation comes as the Trump administration is weighing a possible cyberstrike against Iran, to punish Tehran for what White House officials charge was an Iranian attack on Saudi oil facilities last month.

The report is also an indication that cyberattacks may play a major role in the 2020 presidential campaign, as they did four years ago.
