GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (Reuters) - Ecuador’s President Lenin Moreno said on Friday he was open to talks with protesters but would not withdraw his decision to cut fuel subsidies that have triggered the worst unrest in years.

“Conversation, of course. There will be mechanisms to ease the impact on some sectors,” he told reporters in the coastal city of Guayaquil. “We’re ready to do that, but under no circumstances will we change the measure.”
